Hey! I am Abhijit, a software engineer focused on shipping reliable products with clean developer experience.

Working on web products, developer tooling, and practical AI workflows. I care about systems that stay simple, resilient, and maintainable over time.

I write [blog posts](/posts) about engineering, architecture, and product execution. I also keep notes on workflows and lessons from projects in production.

Outside programming, I enjoy design systems, photography, and exploring better ways to learn in public.
